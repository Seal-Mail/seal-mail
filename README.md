# End-to-end encrypted, private workspace

Seal is a privacy-first, end-to-end encrypted workspace with Mail, Calendar, Pages, and Drive product. This monorepo contains all Seal apps, libraries, and more. You can sign up, use, and even upgrade your account completely privately - even using an anonymous crypto wallet. Upgrade your account for more storage, custom domains, email aliases, version history, and much more.

## Welcome to Seal!

Seal empowers free and more effective communication through private, end-to-end encrypted email. All messages sent between Seal Mail users are end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, Seal never stores unencrypted access to messages sent or received from external mail providers. Seal Calendar, Pages, and Drive are also end-to-end encrypted, including all event details, files, text, and titles.
